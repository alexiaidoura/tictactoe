## Title of the project
Tic Tac Toe

## Description of the project
Simple tic tac toe game using React

## How to Run
Open standalone.html
When the game indicates it's your turn, click a button that hasn't been clicked yet

## Roadmap of future improvements
* Clean up colors using css, modifying bootstrap css
* Prevent user from clicking anything but an available button, give an error explaining that they can't click one already in play, for example (the button will keep track of its state and notify on a subsequent click)
* Have the board flash and play a sound on player win -- using gamestate
